# Python Test Driven Development
This is the github repo for the Python TDD and Deployment course for Salesforce.
This course will cover the following topics:

* Test Driven Development
* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Development
* Building and maintaining coding pipelines in terraform

# Pre-requisites

Before we start we will need the class to have the following items downloaded to their systems:

* Python 3.7 or above
* Terraform
* Your Own AWS account (ideally WITH a separate IAM user with full administrator permissions)
* Jupyter Notebooks (IF you want to do the python refresher)
* Pip (probably comes with Python)

## Module One

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12LEMVJrPdbtktCSXW4fj0Qt4Iyli-tVL/view?usp=sharing) are the slides for module One. We will cover the beginnings of TDD, some of the philosophy, why we do it, etc. 

We will be going over Test driven development as a philosophy. The labs will be simple at this point- practicing with the `assert` module and some basic objects

## Module Two

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lLxgAY5kGzQLAe8oqXplzAhPrxuF_KD9/view?usp=sharing) are the slides for Module TWO- the continuation of TDD 

Here is where we will begin building our application- which will be complex and awesome. We will practice deploying with terraform here.

## Module Three

This will be a lab only portion and will be primarily focused on building out our awesome application. We will be doing heavy python and TDD planning so prepare for that through Module three and four.

## Module Four

Continuing with python planning...but now we can also begin thinking about how to deploy everything we have built! This module will primarily be a continuation of planning and building out our application from module three.

## Module Five

DEPLOYMENT- this is a lab focused module that will focus on how we are going to deploy our new application! We will be setting up and running everything in code pipeline including the build and deploy.

## Module Six

DEPLOYMENT PART 2- this is where we will continue to study the build and deployment steps necessary to creating and maintaining an awesome pipeline.
